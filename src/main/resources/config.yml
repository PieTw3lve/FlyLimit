# Configuration file for FlyLimit plugin

# Ranks Configuration:
# Each rank defines permissions, weight, flight speed, and flight timer.
# Permission specifies the permission node associated with each rank.
# Higher weight values indicate higher priority.
# Flight speed ranges from -1 (slowest) to 1 (fastest), with 0.1 representing creative flight speed.
# Flight timer sets the duration (in seconds) for each rank's flight before auto-disabling.
